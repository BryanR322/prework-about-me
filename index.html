      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a performer at Disney World. I have a Bachelor of Art in Theatre and Bachelor of Science in Graphic Design.  I graduated in April with a Master of Fine Arts in Media Design. I am taking this course to better my skillset and become a more versatile designer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from West Haven, CT but moved to Florida in 2013.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies include design (graphic or interior), crafting, baking, and going to the movies or trying new restaurants.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would is to be a graphic designer for a fashion magazine creating magazine layouts, logos, campaigns, and other print collateral for the brand.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Davenport, FL.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because as a graphic designer many companies require their designers to have experience in coding and web development. During my studies, coding was never a focus. Taking this course will help me learn these skills and help me become a well rounded designer for future employers.</p>
